    "\n",
    "Twitter is a social media platform where users' status updates (tweets) can have the ability to impact how their followers percieve events, [especially in the realm of politics](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/11/us/politics/on-politics-twitter-democrats.html). In this project, we wanted to see how accuractely we could identify users' political affiliations, with the goal of making a model that could be applied to identify like-minded public figures to a given user.\n",
    "\n",
    "Especially with [Twitter's ongoing decline in monthly users](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-07-27/twitter-projects-users-to-decline-profit-short-of-estimates), we hypothesize that such a tool could be used to further establish the site as a more specialized hub for political news and debate and, in turn, drive platform-unique content and reinvigorate overall site traffic. Another high potential use case could involve matching individuals with similarly-aligned local politicians in order to inspire more people to participate in non-federal elections."

    "__NOTE:__ We were not able to obtain as many training users (politicians) as ideal due to the lack of politicians with Twitter accounts active enough to have more than 2,000 tweets since the 2016 presidential election (a limit we saw necessary in case of changes in political affiliation over time). We had no problem finding active pundits on the platform, but restrained our test numbers to scale well with our set of politicians. \n",

    "* Sentiment data may have not been the most accurate given sarcasm, passive agressiveness aimed at other users, etc. \n",
    "* Very skeptical on the scalability of the regression model in Attempt 1 due to the vast number of features compared to data points; very volatile basis for a model\n",
    "* Interestingly though, regression did not perform better when using PCA to reduce the number of features on either setup for the feature matrix\n",
    "* Topic-based models (Attempt 2) did not perform better when using feature reduction via Latent Semantic Indexing (LSI, or LDA with truncated SVD); much worse even when reducing the number of topics\n",
    "* Concerned about the very probable possibility of users not tweeting as we would expect given a certain alignment; need to get multiple users in our dataset who map to the same point to bring stability\n",
    "* Regression as a means of projecting onto the chart was tricky since we lacked enough datapoints at the extremes of the chart to be able to place users towards the corners"
